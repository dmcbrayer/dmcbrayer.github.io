    <p>My name is Daniel McBrayer.  I’m an entrepreneur, an attorney, and a web developer.  This is my personal site, where I practice building things, write a little bit, and show a few projects I’ve started, led, or helped with.</p>

    <p>I have Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and the other things.</p>

    <p>This site is under fairly regular construction.  If you want to see how it's built, check it out <a href="https://github.com/dmcbrayer/dmcbrayer.github.io" target="_blank">here</a>.
